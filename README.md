Analysis of the quality of data used in medical data science. 

## Dataset description
I am using a PhysioNet dataset found here: https://physionet.org/content/accelerometry-walk-climb-drive/1.0.0/

The dataset contains accelerometer data collected from 32 participants. Each participant wore a 4 tri-axial ActiGraph GT3X wearable accelerometers located at the left ankle, right ankle, lip hip, and left wrist. Data was collected from multiple activities: walking, driving, clapping, descending stairs, and ascending stairs.
